# inspec-reporter-json-hdf

This InSpec Reporter Plugin is developed under the [SAF](https://saf.mitre.org/#/) to extend security testing capabilities for the SAF shared community.

* [**Installation**](#installation) 
* [**Manual Attestation**](#manual-attestation)  _**<-- capability to address manual controls!**_
## Installation:
#### if using inspec:
```
inspec plugin install inspec-reporter-json-hdf
```
#### ...or if using cinc-auditor:
```
cinc-auditor plugin install inspec-reporter-json-hdf
```
# Features:
## Manual Attestation
Sometimes requirements (i.e., "InSpec controls") in an InSpec profile require manual review, whereby someone interviews/examines the requirement and confirms (attests as to) whether or not the control requirements have been satisfied. These attestations can be provided to a profile as follows:

### Getting Started:
### Option 1:
#### Step 1: Simply add your attestations to a json file, such as "my_attestations.json". For example:
```
{
    "plugins": {
        "inspec-reporter-json-hdf": {
            "attestations": [
                {
		"control_id": "2.1",
		"explanation": "Discussed with team to ensure a dedicated machine is running this instance of MySQL.",
		"frequency": "annually",
		"status": "passed",
		"updated": "2022-01-02",
		"updated_by": "Json Smith, Security"
                },
                {
		"control_id": "2.4",
		"explanation": "Discussed with team to ensure that neither default nor shared cryptographic material is not being used.",
		"frequency": "every3days",
		"status": "passed",
		"updated": "2022-04-09",
		"updated_by": "Json Smith, Security"
                },
                {
		"control_id": "9.1",
		"explanation": "Reviewed deployment with team to ensure replication traffic is secured and found some connections non-secure.",
		"frequency": "quarterly",
		"status": "failed",
		"updated": "2022-04-02",
		"updated_by": "Json Smith, Security"
                }
		]
        }
    },
    "version": "1.2"
}
```
#### Step 2: Supply this attestations file using the "--config" flag and request the _**HDF**_ reporter:
```
inspec exec <path to InSpec profile> --config <path/attestations_filename>.json --reporter hdf:<path/results_filename>.json 
```
for example:
```
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-ee-5.7-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --config my_attestations.json --reporter hdf:my_results_with_attestations.json 
```
#### Before and after attestation:

### Detailed Usage:
#### Attestations JSON template:
```
{
    "plugins": {
        "inspec-reporter-json-hdf": {
            "attestations": [
                {
		"control_id": "<InSpec Control ID>",
		"explanation": "<Attestation text explaining compliance or non-compliance>",
		"frequency": "<How often this review/attestation needs to be updated - Supported frequency choices:  annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, every2weeks, weekly, every3days, daily>",
		"status": "<assigned status based on review/attestation - Supported status value choices: passed, failed>",
		"updated": "<last date attestation was performed (in YYYY-MM-DD format) - e.g., 2021-04-12>",
		"updated_by": "<Name, Role of person performing attestation for this control>"
                },
                {
		"control_id": "<Another InSpec Control ID>",
		"explanation": "<Attestation text explaining compliance or non-compliance>",
		"frequency": "<How often this review/attestation needs to be updated - Supported frequency choices:  annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, every2weeks, weekly, every3days, daily>",
		"status": "<assigned status based on review/attestation - Supported status value choices: passed, failed>",
		"updated": "<last date attestation was performed (in YYYY-MM-DD format) - e.g., 2021-04-12>",
		"updated_by": "<Name, Role of person performing attestation for this control>"
                }
		]
        }
    },
    "version": "1.2"
}
```
### Option 2 - Use an Excel Spreadsheet for your attestations!

#### Step 1: Add your attestations to an Excel Spreadsheet, such as "my_attestations.xlsx". For [example](https://github.com/mitre/inspec-reporter-json-hdf/blob/main/samples/my_attestations.xlsx):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34140975/163013765-dddccef3-d74a-4872-94fd-eab9196d21a8.png)
#### Step 2: Include your attestations to your config json file, such as "my_attestations.json". For example:
```
{
    "plugins": {
        "inspec-reporter-json-hdf": {
	            "include-attestations-file": {
                "path": "my_attestations.xlsx",
                "type": "xlsx"
            }
        }
    },
    "version": "1.2"
}
```
#### Step 3: Again, supply this attestations file using the "--config" flag and request the _**HDF**_ reporter:
```
inspec exec <path to InSpec profile> --config <path/attestations_filename>.json --reporter hdf:<path/results_filename>.json 
```
for example:
```
inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/oracle-mysql-ee-5.7-cis-baseline/archive/master.tar.gz --config my_attestations.json --reporter hdf:my_results_with_attestations.json 
```
